# Identifying-Influential-Users-in-Social-Networks-Using-SNA-Metrics
## Summary
This project explores the structural properties of social networks using data from the Facebook network. The primary goal is to detect influential users by analyzing the network’s topology through centrality measures. While existing metrics such as degree, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality provide useful insights, they often fall short in capturing influence in complex community-based networks. To address this gap, we propose a novel centrality measure that accounts for both a node’s connectivity and its position within community structures identified using the Louvain algorithm. The new metric emphasizes not just how connected a user is, but how strategically placed they are within or across communities, making it a better indicator of influence in real-world networks. Using NetworkX, we perform community detection, compute various centrality metrics, and visualize the network to compare results. Our findings show that the proposed measure successfully highlights users who may be overlooked by traditional metrics, offering a more nuanced understanding of influence within social graphs.
## Empirical Study
The empirical foundation of this project lies in the detailed examination of a publicly available Facebook social network dataset (https://snap.stanford.edu/data/egonets-Facebook.html), which contains anonymized data reflecting friendships among users. This dataset is structured as an undirected, unweighted graph where each node represents a user, and each edge denotes a mutual friendship.
Firstly, the Louvain algorithm is applied for community detection.  Louvain algorithm is one of the most prominent modularity-based approaches, efficiently partitioning networks into communities while optimizing modularity scores. It is a heuristic method based on modularity optimization.The algorithm works in 2 steps. On the first step it assigns every node to be in its own community and then for each node it tries to find the maximum positive modularity gain by moving each node to all of its neighbor communities. If no positive gain is achieved the node remains in its original community.The modularity gain obtained by moving an isolated node i into a community C can easily be calculated by the following formula:<br>

where m  is the size of the graph, ki,in is the sum of the weights of the links from i to nodes in C, ki is the sum of the weights of the links incident to node i, ∑tot is the sum of the weights of the links incient to nodes in C and γ is the resolution parameter.
This algorithm is selected due to its exceptional scalability, high computational efficiency, and proven ability to optimize modularity—a crucial measure of the quality of community structures. The modular organization of the Facebook graph is uncovered, revealing the natural clusters within the social fabric of the network.<br>

Once community structures are identified, a suite of classical centrality measures—namely, degree, closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality—is computed using the NetworkX library in Python. The results are thoroughly analyzed to discern patterns in node centrality and to highlight the limitations of these traditional approaches in fully capturing the spectrum of influential nodes. These insights directly motivate the creation of a new, more nuanced centrality measure.

The newly proposed centrality measure is then conceptualized, implemented, and systematically applied to the same network. Its performance is evaluated through a comparative analysis against classical metrics, focusing on its ability to detect key influencers both within individual communities and across community boundaries. This is supplemented by a variety of visualizations, including node-link diagrams, centrality heatmaps, and modularity-based community layouts, which serve to illustrate key findings and validate the superiority of the new metric in revealing structural and functional significance within the social network
